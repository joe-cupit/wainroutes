        "text": "Starting in Ambleside, the initial ascent up to Low Pike is rocky and winding. The climb is not too difficult and the views of Lake Windermere behind provide a good excuse for stopping to admire the views. The fields trekked in this section of the walk are often home to a curious herd of highland cattle adding to the fun.",

        "text":  "Reaching the first milestone of Low Pike provides stunning views of the town of Ambleside and the lakes that surround it. The path from this point on is rather undulating and, even though some 450 metres has already been ascended, much more of the walks climb is to come. Something to note from this point is the risk of a boggy trail, with the main guidance being a cobbled wall that spans the ridge for the majority of this half. High Pike is much the same as Low Pike but much higher (as the name would suggest).",

      "Dove and Hart Crag": {
        "text":  "The walk to the next two crags is a long one, but, provided you don't get consumed by cloud, should present great views of both the mountains to come and the surrounding landscape. Those with more time (and energy) can take the opportunity before reaching Dove Crag to bag an extra Wainwright by making their way over to Little Hart Crag.",

On a calm, clear day this makes for the perfect mid-walk resting point to eat lunch and soak in the surroundings.",

        "text": "The exit off of Nab Scar is steep and efficient at bringing this walk to a close and should prove no issue in good conditions. The path comes to a close along the main road traversing the central lakes at a bus stop where a bus can be caught travelling in both directions. As an alternative, the short-ish road to Ambleside can be walked turning this into a perfectly circular walk.",
