            In the 1950s Alfred Wainwright began to release his series of books covering the Lakeland Fells.
            In seven books he wrote about 214 of the most significant and noteworthy peaks.
            Since then, it has become a popular goal among fell enthusiasts to climb all mountains featured in these books, which became known as 'The Wainwrights'.
